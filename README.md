# Choose Your Own Adventure: UNC vs. Duke Basketball Game

## About the Project
This is a Python-based interactive game that transports players to the heart of a high-stakes basketball rivalry between the UNC Tarheels and the Duke Blue Devils. Players will navigate through critical decisions, including free throws and head-to-head matchups, aiming to lead their team to victory and claim the title of the "Best Basketball Team of the Millennium." I created this as a graded project for my Introductory to Programming course (COMP 110).

## Built With:
* Python
* Random module for generating unpredictable game scenarios

## Features
* **Interactive Gameplay**: Players make strategic decisions that influence the game's outcome.
* **Dynamic Scoring System**: Your choices directly affect your team's score, with an algorithm that simulates the unpredictability of a real basketball game.
* **Replayability**: With random elements in each game, no two playthroughs are exactly alike.
